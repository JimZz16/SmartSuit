    <string name="SubTextRealTime">- Range (input): You can change the range, when you go above/below the range you will hear a beep sound (max. range=35, min. range=5). \n- Sound (checkbox): Uncheck this box if you don\'t want to hear a beep sound if the range gets exceeded. \n- Range (checkbox): Check this box if you want to see the range lines (all 3 sensors are individual) If this box is unchecked than all the 3 sensors are working together and they will simulate a human body (midback, C7, head). \n- Advanced (checkbox): Uncheck this if you dont want to see the advanced data. \n- Record (button): This button will start to record the data after pressing the REC image button. The image on the button will change to a stop image and it will stop recording the data. The sensor and location data will be saved in a string while recording. If you end the recording it will upload the string to a FTP server where it will be stored in a text file (name is timestamp).\n- Start (button): This will set the baseline dots, reset the position to zero and set the range. \n- Exit (button): Go back to the main menu.</string>
